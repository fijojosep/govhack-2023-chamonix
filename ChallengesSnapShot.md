# Challenge Ideas
## Diversity in IP Rights System
**Eligibility: Must reference the IP Report - Australian IP Report 2023 | IP. In particular Chapter 7 – Diversity and Innovation.**
Out of the top applicants for patents, trade marks and designs to IP Australia, how can we find out how many are female led, have female friendly hiring policies or otherwise have positive gender/sexual diversity policies, and what industries/technologies are they active in?
Each year, IP Australia publishes the IP Report - Australian IP Report 2023 | IP Australia This provides insight into the IP Rights system in Australia. The Australian IP Report analyses current trends in technology, commercialisation and trade through the latest IP statistics. The 2023 report considers the IP system’s role in harnessing skills, diversity and innovation to create a more productive economy, drawing upon new research by IP Australia and other contributors.
For GovHackers this year we would like to draw your attention to Chapter 7 – Diversity and Innovation. We have published some insights about our knowledge of diversity and innovation.

## Helping women succeed financially
**Eligibility: Must use at least one ATO data set.**
How can financial outcomes for women be improved through increasing diversity and inclusion across industries?
Making it easier to identify which industries women are predominantly employed in and understanding how this compares to their financial outcomes (income sources and amounts, and superannuation) across time and geographical locations can highlight where to target programs to improve their participation in higher paid industries and their financial well-being.

## Measuring Emissions – Where should we start? Standardising data for tracking, monitoring, and reporting emissions
Climate change is forcing governments and regulators to enforce stringent norms for businesses to reduce emissions and address environmental risks. There is no standard framework for reporting ESG and climate related risks, leading to non-uniform data. How can this issue be addressed to help organisations better report on their emissions?
